# Human TNF Gene Analysis
## Project Objective  
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene sequence using various bioinformatics tools such as NCBI, BioEdit, PROMO, GENSCAN, and MEME Suite. This project is a task of the BioinformHER  
The steps involved include- 
* Download the Human TNF gene sequence from NCBI and View/Edit it using BioEdit
* Generate the translated sequence of the gene using BioEdit 
* Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs) present within the gene sequence using the BioEdit ORF Finder Tool and record the start/stop positions, lengths, and protein translations of the ORFs 
* Analyze the sequence nucleotide composition using BioEdit by calculating the frequencies of each nucleotide, and overall GC content. Interpret the results. 
* Identify transcription factor binding sites using the PROMO tool 
* Search for functional motifs in the TNF gene sequence using the MEME Suite 
* Predict the coding/non-coding regions within the gene sequence using the GENSCAN tool 
* Convert sequence file format from FASTA to PHYLIP in BioEdit
