# Human TNF Gene Analysis
## Project Objective  
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene sequence using various bioinformatics tools such as NCBI, BioEdit, PROMO, GENSCAN, and MEME Suite. This mini project is the first task of the BioinformHER Module 1. BioinformHER is an initiative taken by HackBio aimed at introducing young women in STEM to Bioinformatics using simple and easy-to-follow guidelines.
### Steps involved in gene analysis
* Download the Human TNF gene sequence from NCBI and View/Edit it using BioEdit
* Generate the translated sequence of the gene using BioEdit 
* Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs) present within the gene sequence using the BioEdit ORF Finder Tool and record the start/stop positions, lengths, and protein translations of the ORFs 
* Analyze the sequence nucleotide composition using BioEdit by calculating the frequencies of each nucleotide, and overall GC content. Interpret the results. 
* Identify transcription factor binding sites using the PROMO tool 
* Search for functional motifs in the TNF gene sequence using the MEME Suite 
* Predict the coding/non-coding regions within the gene sequence using the GENSCAN tool 
* Convert sequence file format from FASTA to PHYLIP in BioEdit
